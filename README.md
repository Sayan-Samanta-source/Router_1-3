# Router_1-3
A 1×3 router splits one input signal into three outputs, enabling signal distribution in optical or data communication networks efficiently.


Router 1x3 - FSM-Based Packet Switching Module

This project implements a 1x3 Router design in Verilog, developed and synthesized using the MobaXterm terminal environment. The design uses a single Finite State Machine (FSM) to control routing logic, one register for temporary data storage, one synchronizer to ensure signal integrity across clock domains, and three First-In-First-Out (FIFO) buffers to handle data transmission to three different output channels. The router accepts incoming data from one input source and distributes it based on the destination address to one of three output ports (P0, P1, or P2). This efficient design leverages modularity and synchronization techniques to ensure robust and reliable data communication, even in the presence of asynchronous inputs. The FSM manages packet detection, data validation, and routing decisions. The register stores the header or control information temporarily during packet parsing. The synchronizer addresses metastability issues, especially when interfacing with asynchronous signals or modules working on different clock edges. Each of the three FIFOs stores and buffers the outgoing data to ensure smooth and independent data flow to each destination, preventing data loss or congestion. The FIFO implementation also handles status flags such as full, empty, and almost full, enabling back-pressure control and avoiding data overflow. The entire RTL code has been written in Verilog HDL, adhering to synthesizable design principles, and structured for clarity, modularity, and reuse. The design was tested through simulation using testbenches that verify functional correctness under various input conditions, including edge cases like simultaneous packet arrivals and FIFO overflows. Synthesis was performed using tools within the MobaXterm Linux-like environment, showcasing compatibility with open-source toolchains and supporting Verilog simulation and analysis. This project serves as a solid foundation for understanding routing mechanisms, FSM-based control logic, and FIFO data handling in digital design. It can be extended to implement packet-based communication systems, NoC (Network on Chip) routers, or custom data switches in ASIC or FPGA environments. The repository includes the Verilog source files, synthesized netlist, testbenches, waveform screenshots, and a brief report summarizing the design flow, simulation results, and synthesis metrics. Users can easily modify parameters like FIFO depth, packet size, and routing policy to tailor the router for custom use cases. This project is ideal for students, researchers, and engineers looking to study or prototype scalable routing architectures using simple yet powerful Verilog design patterns. Contributions are welcome, and suggestions or feature requests can be submitted via issues or pull requests. The main goal is to promote hands-on learning and encourage collaborative development of digital system designs. Please refer to the README for setup instructions, file structure explanation, and usage guide. This project reflects good practices in hardware design and offers insight into synchronizer logic, finite state control, and pipelined data handling using FIFOs—all within the context of a streamlined and practical 1x3 Router module.
